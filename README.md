<p align="center">
  An overall system watcher with a C++23 core and a minimal UI: a notch display and a settings menu.
</p>

## Status

The macOS app shows live CPU, memory, and disk usage around the notch. Hover over the notch to
expand it, and open **Settings** from there to change the update interval, the metrics beside the
notch, and launch at login.

## Build and test

Requires CMake 3.29 or later, Ninja, a C++23 compiler, and Swift 6.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
open build/HuginMunin.app
```

To quit the app, hover over the notch and click **Quit**.
